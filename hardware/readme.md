# Hardware 

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W 2
   - > RPI Zero W (One) works fine as well. The Wifi was a bit more limited 
2. WS1361 Digital Sound Level Meter Pressure Tester 30-130dB Decibel USB Noise Measurement [Link](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832141769885.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.70961802K1eVUe&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)
3. Cases: See attached soundsensor-case.3mf files
4. Power Adapter: Make sure to use at minimum a 5V 2.4A reliable power supply. I suggest using well known brand, like Anker. 
   1. I suffered from this, using an old iPhone brick which only supplied 5V/1A. But any 12W adapter should work fine. 
5. Get a reliable SD card. I try to get at least XC type.
